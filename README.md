## ðŸ§  Abstract

This pilot study presents the development of the **InfoTech Assistant**, a domain-specific, multimodal chatbot engineered to address queries in bridge evaluation and infrastructure technology. By integrating web data scraping, large language models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the InfoTech Assistant provides accurate and contextually relevant responses. 

It features:
- A user-friendly HTML interface
- A Flask back end
- Integration with the Llama 3.1 model via LLM Studio
- A structured JSON knowledge base containing 41 bridge technologies from publicly available infrastructure data

Evaluation results show ~95% accuracy on domain-specific tasks, confirming the effectiveness of the RAG-enhanced setup.
